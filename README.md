YFT is an equilibrium-based theoretical framework in which physical
reality is organized by stability rather than by symmetry or
fundamental entities. Particles, interactions, and spacetime emerge
as regime-dependent manifestations of a single underlying
equilibrium structure.

## Core Ideas
- Equilibrium as the primary organizing principle
- Three equilibrium channels: scalar, phase, and geometric
- Mass and constants as equilibrium projections
- Regime transitions via stability breakdown
- A screened, equilibrium-mediated fifth-force signature
