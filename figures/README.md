## Illustrative Figures (Conceptual & Physical Analogies)

### Topological Defects and Phase Structure
These figures illustrate half-integer and integer topological defects
(comet, trefoil, vortex, aster, pineapple) that serve as physical
analogies for internal phase-equilibrium structures discussed in YFT.

### Phase Equilibrium on Internal Spheres
Geometric representations of internal equilibrium phases and their
projection onto observable spin and polarization structures.

### Non-Abelian Vortices and Equilibrium Screening
Illustrations of non-Abelian vortex configurations and screening
mechanisms, conceptually related to equilibrium channel suppression.

### Lattice Spin and Gauge Textures
Spin textures on discrete lattices illustrating gauge redundancy as
an equilibrium representation rather than a fundamental interaction.

### Astrophysical Equilibrium Structures
Observed and simulated large-scale equilibrium manifestations,
including galaxy clusters, lensing structures, and filamentary
distributions relevant to geometric equilibrium regimes.
